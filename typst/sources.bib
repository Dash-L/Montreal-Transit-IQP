	abstract = {Public transportation is, overall, a relatively safe (low crash risk) and secure (low crime risk) transport mode. Transit travel has about one-tenth the traffic casualty (injury or death) rate as automobile travel, and residents of transit-oriented communities have about one-fifth the per capita crash casualty rate as in automobile-oriented communities. Transit also tends to have lower overall crime rates than automobile travel, and transit improvements can help reduce overall crime risk by improving surveillance and economic opportunities for at-risk populations. Despite its relative safety and security, many people consider transit travel dangerous and are reluctant to use it or support service expansions in their communities. Various factors contribute to this excessive fear, including the nature of transit travel, heavy media coverage of transit-related crashes and crimes, and conventional traffic safety messages that emphasize danger rather than safety. Transit agencies can help create a new transit safety narrative by better communicating transit’s overall safety and security impacts and providing better guidance concerning how users and communities can enhance transit safety and security.},

Public transportation has a special role in avoiding congestion and consequent environmental and health impacts but is considered expensive.
The objective of this paper was to analyze the benefits of the São Paulo subway in terms of the air pollution in the city through strikes events, analyzing both the health outcomes and the related economic burden. For the strike events, increases in air pollutant concentrations during the strike day was observed when compared to a similar day in terms of day of the week and meteorological conditions. Increases in mortality were also observed and the associated economic burden calculated. Despite the elevated construction and operation costs of the subway, when environment and social values are considered, cost-benefit analysis results would indicate a worthwhile investment. The consideration of these aspects is essential to sustainable transportation analyses, and in the case of the São Paulo subway, our analysis clearly demonstrated the important role of this system in the city's environmental, social and economic attributes.

Consideration of these health benefits would allow transit proponents to better demonstrate its true costs and benefits. In light of transit’s potential health-related impacts, this study contributes to the growing discussion in the emerging field of health and transportation by providing a review of the current level of understanding and evidence related to the physical activity implications of transit use and its associated health cost benefits. Findings from the review revealed that transit use is associated with increased levels of physical activity and improved health outcomes, but the magnitude of these effects is uncertain. There were few studies that estimated the health care cost savings of transit systems, and those that did tended to be imprecise and simplistic. Objective physical activity measures and frequency-based transit measures would allow for greater consistency across studies and help more directly attribute physical activity gains to transit ridership. Additionally, research in this area would benefit from disaggregate estimation techniques and more robust health datasets that can be better linked with existing transit data.},

	abstract = {Infrastructure investments have long been a key factor driving the economic and urban development of a country. These investments usually require a large amount of funds, but funding for such investments is often limited to catching up with the growing urban population, especially for cities in emerging economies. As a result, finding alternative funding for infrastructure investment is increasingly important. Land value capture ({LVC}) is one of the mechanisms that can be used to fund infrastructure investment. An important policy question for the land value capture is determining how much of the increment land values are due to infrastructure investment. This research aims to assess the land value increment due to proximity to public transit, using Bangkok as a case study. The analysis employs hedonic regressions of low-rise residential real estate projects from 2009 to 2017 in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. The results suggest that the proximity to the nearest mass transit stations has driven up the land values of residential lands in real estate development projects. In addition, the bid-rent coefficients over time have increased in magnitude in the latter years as more transit stations have opened, suggesting the presence of temporal effects from various stages of mass transit investments on land values. The analysis also assesses the value that can be captured through a tax-based {LVC} mechanism around a new mass transit station.},

They are among the most visible mode of transportation both due to their size, which has increased over time, and to the infrastructures on which they rely to park and move. This paper proposes new metrics to consider the space and energy consumption of cars in cities. Road network data is used to evaluate the network coverage. Car trips from travel surveys combined to car fleet datasets are used to evaluate the surface (2D) and volume (3D) footprints of cars over time and across space. The energy footprint of car trips is also evaluated, namely regarding the activity and the duration of the activity they allow to reach. Results show the important transformation of the car fleet and the increasing 2D and 3D footprint they have. They also demonstrate that larger cars reduce parking capacity, increase congestion, and prevent energy savings.},

	abstract = {Current urban mobility systems in Europe, characterized by high car mobility shares, have negative environmental and health impacts but struggle to mitigate these for fear of sacrificing accessibility. Ironically, before the car mobility transition (in the 1950s and 1960s in Western countries and the 1990s in Eastern Europe), most cities were accessible by walking, cycling, public transport, and by the few cars there were. Through a longitudinal case study of a medium-sized urban area in Clermont-Ferrand, France (1950–2022), this paper explores the potential to ‘de-transition’, i.e., to reverse the urban transition process towards ‘accessible, low-car cities’ by reshaping infrastructures to constrain car use whilst accommodating walking, cycling, and public transport. We answer the following questions: To what extent can cities reverse the urban car mobility transition? How could such a process be further encouraged? Our analysis adopts a social practices perspective and uses a mixed-methods approach by combining semi-structured interviews, a survey, and a document analysis. On the one hand, our findings highlight the difficulty of an urban modality shift to car alternatives: (1) the limited reach of public transformation networks (in Clermont-Ferrand, the tramline); (2) the fact that many feel unsafe or assume they need excellent health conditions to cycle, which is associated with leisure and sports; and (3) strong convictions concerning the usefulness of vehicle ownership, which is believed to maximise comfort. On the other hand, based on a historic analysis, we offer practical recommendations to de-transition to low-car urban areas: (1) the creation of an extensive regional tramway network; (2) the development of a full cycling network; and (3) the promotion of an extensive car-free city centre.},

This literature review synthesises the negative consequences of automobility, or car harm, which we have grouped into four categories: violence, ill health, social injustice, and environmental damage. We find that, since their invention, cars and automobility have killed 60–80 million people and injured at least 2 billion. Currently, 1 in 34 deaths are caused by automobility. Cars have exacerbated social inequities and damaged ecosystems in every global region, including in remote car-free places. While some people benefit from automobility, nearly everyone—whether or not they drive—is harmed by it. Slowing automobility's violence and pollution will be impracticable without the replacement of policies that encourage car harm with policies that reduce it. To that end, the paper briefly summarises interventions that are ready for implementation.},

Montreal officials dubbed it the metro because that's what they called it in Paris. And just like in Paris, Montreal trains whizzed by on rubber tires--a sign that Montreal was entering a new era.


This is an example of the incredible artwork in the Montreal metro system. It's a decorative glass wall created by the artist Frédéric Back in 1967, and it pays tribute to Montreal's music icons.},

First the paper offers a review of key sustainable transportation concepts and how public transport contributes to sustainability goals. Second, the paper reviews past studies that analyse sustainable transportation in order to develop recommendations for planning, engineering, and researching sustainable public transport. Finally, the paper concludes by offering suggestions for future research into the sustainability performance of public transit.},

	abstract = {The promotion of electric mobility has the potential to reduce several impacts of the road transport sector, such as increased emissions of greenhouse gas ({GHG}) and air pollutants and natural resource depletion. As such, decision makers and other stakeholders around the world have invested significant efforts in the transition to sustainable urban mobility based on the use of electric vehicles. However, there are few studies that investigate the potential benefits of electric mobility in all its facets; i.e., most focus on analyzing the benefits of replacing conventional cars while leaving aside other means of transportation with greater use and, consequently, higher emissions, such as, primarily, public transport and freight transport vehicles. Thus, this study aims to develop an action plan focused on electric mobility—{APOEM}, which stipulates gradual implementation steps in a time horizon of 5 years. For this purpose, a city with potential for electric mobility implementation called Atibaia, in the countryside of the State of São Paulo, in Brazil, is investigated. The results show that, in an ambitious scenario of electric vehicle deployment in the City of Atibaia, which presents energy supply compatible with demand, it would be possible to reduce a total of 30,788.70 tons of {GHG} in 5 years, and, as for emissions of air pollutants, it would be possible to reduce 140.38 tons of {CO}, 36.38 tons of {NMHC}, 1.58 tons of {RCHO}, 130.20 tons of {NOx}, 3.54 tons of {MP} and 0.75 tons of {SO}2 in 5 years. It is also worth noting that, in order for electrification to generate a greater contribution to the environment, it is necessary that electric mobility be generated from renewable energy sources.},

There are various {TOD} assessment methods; each target one of these goals. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach that addresses {TOD} goals in a multistage assessment. In the first stage, we identify station areas' typology using weighted node, place, and tie indices based on the correlation between land use and transportation. Then, feasible station areas for enhancing density and diversity are selected using a canonical score. In the second stage, station areas' typology is defined by sustainability criteria and a {TOD} index. Then, the efficiency of selected station areas for compactness is assessed using Data Envelopment Analysis. Finally, public transport accessibility is optimized for these stations in the third stage. We investigate the effects of weighting indicators of the node?place model in the first stage and aggregation methods in the second stage. We conduct a feasibility and efficiency assessment for the typology of station areas in Metro Montreal. This study attempts to advocate a holistic perspective for {TOD} assessment with a case study implementation.},

	abstract = {Active travel ({AT}), which commonly implies walking and cycling, is a critical component in any modern urban transportation system. {AT} is sustainable, equitable, cost-effective, gender-neutral, and serves as an important mitigation measure for transport-driven greenhouse gases ({GHGs}) while promoting healthy lifestyle and social wellbeing. However, vehicle-centric urban planning has resulted in lower levels of {AT} in many countries. Studies evaluating the effects of {AT} on society and ecosystems tend to highlight the tangible benefits over the intangible ones, potentially missing the broader advantages of {AT}. Furthermore, there is a considerable difference in adopting {AT} promoting measures and policies between the developing and the developed worlds. There are several economic methods to evaluate various aspects of {AT}, among which cost-benefit analysis ({CBA}) is widely used. However, for a more informed decision-making by political leadership, it is essential to adopt a comprehensive evaluation methodology that covers the full spectrum of costs and benefits associated with {AT}, hereby enabling better urban transport planning. This paper will comprehensively evaluate the benefits and costs associated with {AT} and, highlight how traditional {CBA} often undervalues {AT} by ignoring some of its critical costs and benefits.},

	abstract = {Significant global investments are being made into smart urban mobility technologies but there is limited evidence of the potential co-benefits for reducing carbon emissions, environmental pollutants and human health impacts at scale and over the long-term. We use conservative estimates of vehicle electrification and grid decarbonisation to focus specifically on information and communication technology ({ICT}) interventions. In doing so, we develop a smart mobility framework focusing on more efficient road networks and driving behaviour enabled by rapid {ICT} deployment. Our scenarios suggest that a combination of ambitious policy measures aimed at smoothing traffic speeds as well as improving driver behaviour in urban areas could reduce carbon emissions for cars ∼29\% saving ∼7 {MtCO}2 and for vans ∼33\% saving ∼3 {MtCO}2 by 2050. Potential reductions in nitrogen oxides and particulate matter 2.5 for cars are ∼22\% and vans ∼10\% and ∼16\% respectively. We use human toxicological classification of air pollution ({HCA}) to assess the potential damage on human health and our scenarios suggest an upper range of ∼23\% and ∼30\% reductions in {HCA} by 2050 for cars and vans respectively. Using conservative cost values, we estimate damage costs could be avoided from car emissions range from ∼£42–£130 million and vans ∼£89–£163 million per year. However, our baseline projections indicate that emissions and damage costs avoided from passenger cars could be partially offset by growing demand for urban van delivery and freight services that are currently outpacing improved fuel and emissions performance of the vehicle stock. This may reflect broader lifestyle and consumer trends towards on-line shopping, food and delivery services, which warrants further investigation.},

This study investigates {TTV} metrics within the context of shared mobility using probe data from transportation network companies ({TNCs}) in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Dallas–Fort Worth. Eight reliability metrics are analyzed and compared for each origin–destination ({OD}) pair in the network, including standard deviation ({SD}), the Planning Time Index ({PTI}), the Travel Time Index ({TTI}), the Buffer Index ({BI}), On-time Measures {PR} (alpha), and the Misery Index ({MI}), to evaluate their effectiveness in clustering {OD} pairs using K-means clustering. The findings confirm that {SD}, {PTI}, and {MI} are particularly effective in measuring travel time reliability and clustering within urban systems. This study identifies the most unbalanced supply–demand {OD} pairs/regions in each city, noting that low/medium-{SD} clusters around metropolitan airports indicate stable travel times even in high-demand zones, while high-{SD} clusters in downtown areas reveal significant traffic demands and unreliability. These patterns become more pronounced in study areas with multiple city centers. This study highlights the need for targeted strategies to enhance travel time reliability, particularly in regions like Dallas–Fort Worth, where public transportation alternatives are limited.},

However, results accuracy crucially depends on methodological and empirical considerations such as: i) presence of spatial latent component (spatial autocorrelation); ii) temporal breaks related to different periods over which the infrastructure is built; and iii) heterogeneity of the effect along the line and stations. This paper aims to assess the impact of Montréal's metro extension to the suburb city of Laval (announced in 1998 and started operating in 2007). A spatial difference-in-difference ({SDID}) estimator based on a repeated sales approach is used to isolate the impact of the proximity to the new infrastructure on single-family house prices depending on the implementation phases and the stations. The results suggest that among the three new infrastructures, only one shows a positive impact of proximity after the first operation of the transit service. The study results tend to relativize the sometimes high expectations in terms of economic impacts of such a project, at least for residential properties.},
